## Introduction

Stripe Pad is a server-rendered PHP boilerplate for building SaaS products with Stripe — old-school, simple, and fast.
It uses PHP as both backend and template engine, with as little JavaScript as possible. Everything runs directly on your server, no build steps or frontend frameworks required.

You get a complete foundation ready to customize:

* Landing page, admin dashboard, private area for registered users
* User authentication, Stripe payments, and webhooks
* SQLite database and MVC structure (Models, Views, Controllers)
* Google login, SMTP transactional emails, and optional OpenAI module

The code is meant to be edited directly:

* Change HTML by editing /views templates
* Add routes or logic in /app/App.php or /landing/Landing.php
* Create or extend database models in /app/models

Stripe Pad handles user access and payments, while giving you a clean base to build on — you can later plug in React, Vue, or any JS framework inside the /app private area if you need it.

Licensed under GPL-3.0, Stripe Pad is your minimal, transparent starting point for a fully functional SaaS.
