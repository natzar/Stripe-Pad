## Introduction

**Stripe Pad** is the PHP boilerplate to build SaaS with Stripe. Stripe Pad is a GPL3-licensed PHP-based MVC framework that saves you months of development by starting you off with all the features, Stripe integration included, that are the same in every product, so you can focus on what makes your app unique.
